# Ping

Ping is a self-hosted collaboration platform that offers chat, workflow automation, voice calling, screen sharing, and AI integration. This repo is the primary source for core development on the Ping platform; it's written in Go and React, runs as a single Linux binary, and relies on PostgreSQL.
